(WIP) Currently untitled card game I'm creating for practice utilizing Godot. Will expand this file as the project moves further along.

Current status (24.05.2024): Has the groundwork needed for the object-oriented deck logic and some test printing functions, that's about it

TODO: 

- Combat, improve effect functionality
- The front-end as a whole
- Design cards
