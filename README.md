(WIP) Currently untitled card game I'm creating for practice utilizing Godot. Will expand this file as the project moves further along.

Current status (10.06.2024, 01:05 am): Backend is now much more expansive, Cards can be moved pretty much anywhere and play conditions are starting to take form.
Also  cleaned up a bit of placeholder code.

TODO: 

- Combat, improve effect functionality
- The front-end as a whole
- Design cards
