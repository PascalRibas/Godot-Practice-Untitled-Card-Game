(WIP) Currently untitled TCG-esque two-player card game I'm creating for practice utilizing Godot. Will expand this file as the project moves further along.

Current status (10.06.2024, 01:05 am): Backend is now much more expansive, Cards can be moved pretty much anywhere and play conditions are starting to take form.
Also  cleaned up a bit of placeholder code. Additional notes (26.10.2024, 10:43 pm): Project is on ice for now, may continue in 2025 or 2026.

TODO: 

- Combat, improve effect functionality
- The front-end as a whole
- Design cards
